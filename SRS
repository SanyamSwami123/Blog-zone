Project Plan:  BlogZone
1. Introduction
This document lays out a project plan for the development of “BlogZone” open source 
repository system by Sanyam Swami.
The intended readers of this document are current and future developers working on 
“BlogZone” and the sponsors of the project. The plan will include, but is not restricted
to, a summary of the system functionality, the scope of the project from the perspective 
of the “BlogZone” team (me and my mentors), scheduling and delivery estimates, project
risks and how those risks will be mitigated, the process by which I will develop the 
project, and metrics and measurements that will be recorded throughout the project.
