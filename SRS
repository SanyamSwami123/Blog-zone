Project Plan:  BlogZone
1. Introduction
This document lays out a project plan for the development of “BlogZone” open source 
repository system by Sanyam Swami.
The intended readers of this document are current and future developers working on 
“BlogZone” and the sponsors of the project. The plan will include, but is not restricted
to, a summary of the system functionality, the scope of the project from the perspective 
of the “BlogZone” team (me and my mentors), scheduling and delivery estimates, project
risks and how those risks will be mitigated, the process by which I will develop the 
project, and metrics and measurements that will be recorded throughout the project.

2. Overview
In today’s world, owning to the heavy workload on the employees, they are having huge amount of stress in their lives.
Even with the presence of so many gadgets in and around them, they are not able to relieve their stress. 
I aim to develop an application that would enable them to share the thing of their liking and meet the person
who have the same passion as theirs. For eg. If someone wants to share their art, they can share it through the platform.
Through my platform, I’ll enable them to meet people who share the common interests and passion, chat with them and have some fun.
